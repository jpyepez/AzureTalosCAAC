# AzureTalosCAAC

Azure Talos is an expressive multi-string mechatronic chordophone. This repository includes a collection of computer-aided algorithmic composition (CAAC) and interaction examples. Each composition explores a different type of CAAC system that can be played by Azure Talos.

## Examples:

1. Randomness: A dice game that randomly selects pre-composed musical blocks subsequently.
2. Probability: A stochastic arpeggiator that plays different string patterns for various chord progressions.
3. Phase Music: A phase composition that explores three concurrent voices that are displaced by a few milliseconds to generate constantly evolving musical patterns.
4. CAAC_Interaction: Randomness and probability examples controlled via MaxMSP user interfaces.
